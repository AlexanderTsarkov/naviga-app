# Archive: OOTB v1 working artifacts

**What:** Working documentation used during OOTB v1 planning and execution (completed 2026-02-12).  
**Why archived:** These are trail/planning artifacts; canonical navigation and snapshot live in the main docs tree. Kept here for history and traceability.

**Canonical docs (start here):**

- [docs/START_HERE.md](../../docs/START_HERE.md) — Entrypoint
- [docs/project/state_after_ootb_v1.md](../../docs/project/state_after_ootb_v1.md) — State snapshot
- [docs/project/docs_map.md](../../docs/project/docs_map.md) — Canonical vs reference vs archived

PR2 (Issue #119) created the canonical set; PR3 moved these working artifacts and updated links.
