# Product spec WIP

**Status:** Work in progress. **Do not use as implementation requirements.** Implementation must follow [../areas/](../areas/) and approved ADRs/specs.

## WIP statuses

- **Idea** — Early exploration; not yet a candidate.
- **Candidate** — Option or proposal under evaluation.
- **Ready-to-promote** — Decision ready; summarize into [../areas/](../areas/) and link back here.

## Promotion rule

When a product decision is ready: add or update the canon doc in [../areas/](../areas/) (e.g. `nodetable.md`, `groups.md`, `power.md`), then keep a short link from that area doc back to the WIP index or note for history.

## Research (long-lived)

External comparisons, Meshtastic/analog research, and long-lived investigation live under **areas by product area:**

- [areas/nodetable/](areas/nodetable/) — NodeTable / identity / discovery.
- [areas/groups/](areas/groups/) — Groups / sessions / roles.
- [areas/power/](areas/power/) — Power / battery / radio usage.

Each area has an `index.md` (options, current leaning, promotion criteria) and `research/` (sources, what to steal / not steal, mapping to Naviga, open questions).
