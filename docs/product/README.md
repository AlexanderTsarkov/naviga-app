# Product documentation — current truth

**Repo-wide doc entry:** [docs/START_HERE.md](../START_HERE.md). This README is the entry point for **product** docs only.

## Current truth (canon)

- **Areas (by product area):** [areas/nodetable.md](areas/nodetable.md), [areas/groups.md](areas/groups.md), [areas/power.md](areas/power.md) — stable, implementation-facing decisions.
- **Existing product docs** in this folder (e.g. [naviga_product_core.md](naviga_product_core.md), [ootb_scope_v0.md](ootb_scope_v0.md), [naviga_join_session_logic_v1_2.md](naviga_join_session_logic_v1_2.md), [naviga_mesh_protocol_concept_v1_4.md](naviga_mesh_protocol_concept_v1_4.md)) remain part of current truth unless superseded by an area doc or ADR.

## WIP (not implementation requirements)

- **[wip/](wip/)** — Product-spec work in progress: options, research, candidate decisions. **Do not treat WIP as implementation requirements.** When a decision is ready, promote into [areas/](areas/) and keep a link back to WIP history.

## Glossary

- [glossary.md](glossary.md) — Terms and definitions (stub; extend as needed).
